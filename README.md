Feel free to submit issues or open pull requests. If you want to know where to help, refer to the existing issues.

## Guidelines 

### Format
Run `cargo fmt` before committing.

### Commit messages:

- We follow the [Conventional Commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Our commit types are inspired by the [Karma specification](http://karma-runner.github.io/6.4/dev/git-commit-msg.html)
  ```
  <type>[optional scope]: <description>

  [optional body]

  [optional footer(s)]
  ```

  Allowed <type> values: 
  - **feat** for a new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a MINOR version.
  - **fix** for a bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a PATCH version.
  - **perf** for performance improvements. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a PATCH version.
  - **docs** for changes to the documentation.
  - **style** for formatting changes, missing semicolons, etc.
  - **refactor** for refactoring production code, e.g. renaming a variable.
  - **test** for adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change.
  - **build** for updating build configuration, development tools or other changes irrelevant to the user.

- Write commit messages in the present tense (e.g., "Add feature X" instead of "Added feature X").

### Branches
- Use the naming convention `<type>/<name>` for branches introducing new features. Only use lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes.
- The `main` branch should always compile successfully and be free of warnings. Use `cargo check`.
- Experimental branches are allowed to include code that does not build successfully.
- Prefer rebasing over merging.
